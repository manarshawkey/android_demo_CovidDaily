# Covid Daily Report

This is a demo Android app. The app provides recent information
about the number of Covid-19 confirmed cases and mortalities
during the past 10 days, in a country of the usersâ€™ choice.
The application also sends a daily reminder for the users
to keep their face-mask on if they're in a crowded place.

## Use Cases
1. View Covid-19 records of the past 10 days on the main Activity
2. Press a record to show more info in a new activity
3. Share the info over other apps
4. Choose one out of three countries to get its Covid data
5. Enable and disable the notifications

## Notes
1. This app is for educational purposes only.
2. All data used in this app is from [this API](https://about-corona.net/documentation)
3. The info about Covid-19 data in Egypt might
   be a little bit misleading, since the
   number of daily confirmed cases
   and daily mortalities are 0 in most of
   the records. This is not a bug, the ministry
   of health announces the data on a weekly  not
   daily basis since March 12nd.
